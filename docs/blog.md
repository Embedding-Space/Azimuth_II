# Title to Come

## Introduction: What Were We Even Doing in There?

[Short section explainining how we've been interested in hidden space since the steering experiment (link) and we read that one paper that's in our references.bib and it was like "there's geometry to the unembedding matrix" so we decided to go exploring.]

## Initial Explorations and The Overdensity

[How about first we map the sky, like with our eyes? That could be cool, and besides eyes are really good at detecting patterns in stuff. Show sky plots. WHAMMO the overdensity appears (see 1.3a, 1.3b).]

[Norm histogram, "the spike" appears. (1.2a)]

[We use the sky maps to block out a sector of interest in r, longitude and latitude. (1.5b) Nearest-neighbor analysis (1.4f) shows huge number of tokens with very close neighbors. We build an adjacency graph, discover it's like a solid 2,212-token ball floating in a gas (1.4g).]

[Let's map it as if we were at the center. (1.6c) Let's do axial tomography (1.6d). There's something in slices 6 and 7, and in slices 7-14 it looks like there's a radially symmetric cloud of diffuse points. Let's zoom in on slices 6 and 7. (1.6f). Density is anistropic. Let's zoom in more. (1.6g). There you are, you lil sos-n-sos.]

## Is This a Problem? A Digression on Decoding

[In here we talk about how decoding works, and distinguishability through cosine similarity and logit scoring. The cluster tokens got the EXACT SAME logit scores (1.7c). So what, lots of tokens do in that middle orthogonal band. No really, these are indistinguishable even if you look directly at them (1.7e, 1.7f).]
