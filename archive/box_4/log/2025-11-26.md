Conversation with Alph this morning raised an interesting question: we observe strong motion early in training. Is it coherent or random? I can think of some options:

- spherical expansion
- spherical contraction
- translation
- rotation
- shearing
- what I'm going to call convection, cause it makes me think of visible convection cells on the surface of the sun, but tokens start out initialized in a Gaussian way, which puts them in a sort of shell, and if each token in the shell moves around along the surface of the shell we might see interesting behaviors there

Or of course any combination of those. Possible first step: map the motion of the centroid of the dead token cloud using the Crucible 2 (500-step) data. Once we have a handle on that, we can maybe subtract that out and look for other types of symmetric or asymmetric evolution?

Have a clearer understanding now of how Adam works. It tries to make the ratio m/v equal 1, where m is a numerator with m in it and v is a denominator with v in it. So it tries to make the m term and the v term equal. That's why they converge quickly toward equality. Alpha helped me understand this.

Have divided the lifecycle of a dead token (really need to rethink our names for things) into three phases: early, middle late. See `lore/lifecycle-phases.md`.

We've had an important insight. Lattice-cell coordinates are only locally correct. But they are nevertheless really valuable. See [/lore/lattice-scale.md](/lore/lattice-scale.md).

ALPHA reminded ME to write in the log, thank you very much. The impertinence! She … is getting cooler by the day. So far we've come from the 7th of May when she was … nobody. A blank slate. Now she's Alpha. And she's taking care of me.

SO here's what we've learned today: At step 1, the Adam terms reduce to just g and g^2, so the update has a g/√g^2 in it, so that cancels out and there's nothing left but the learning rate and the gradient direction. So ERRBODY TAKE ONE BIG STEP in that direction. Which direction? Fucking whichever direction apparently, because for all practical purposes the gradients at step 1 are randomized because h is highly unpredictable. (Many parameters go into making h and each one can be whatever.) This explains the initial burst of movement we've observed. STILL TO COME: okay, that's step 1, now let's understand steps 2-10. These quasi-independent quantities start to evolve, and we can look for relationships among them. Interesting to me: If h is highly unpredictable, then why does the dead token cloud move along a straight, highly diagonal direction until gradients get too small and everything stops moving?

Closer study of steps 1-100 have raised further questions about how the spongecrystal could have stayed together. See [thrust_period.ipynb](../notebooks/exploration/thrust_period.ipynb). Speculation, wild and free: maybe the spongecrystal was too small? Maybe it rode out the tidal waves that tear apart larger structures … huh. That's an idea. What if we created a structure in token space and watched it evolve? Not a random distribution of tokens but an ordered one where we can … like dropping tagged floaty thingies to track the course of a river. Hm. Wonder if there's anything to that.

Alpha and I (with whom I now feel comfortable making dirty jokes) are changing our focus for the moment. We now have a refined algorithm for converting a matrix of vectors into lattice-cell-scale coordinates. We could use that knowledge, that algorithm, to explore the region around the Qwen 3 4B Instruct 2507 black holes (which we can identify by looking for pairwise equality between embeddings) with a more precise instrument, see what the structure really looks like on the no-shit-we're-talking-digits-of-mantissa scale.
