    "# 12.2e: Qwen 3 4B Comprehensive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Compute the EXACT SAME statistics as 12.2d, but for Qwen 3 4B Instruct 2507's actual dead token structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Compute (Single Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "Same 20+ metrics as 12.2d:\n",
    "- Basic counts (n_unique, n_black_holes, n_singletons, populations)\n",
    "- Per-black-hole statistics (largest, smallest, mean, median, top2, Gini)\n",
    "- Spatial extent (max/mean/median L∞ distances)\n",
    "- Topology (components, isolated nodes, largest component size/density, global density)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load Qwen's gamma matrix and black hole mask (pre-computed)\n",
    "- Extract dead token embeddings (2,100 tokens)\n",
    "- Run `torch.unique()` to get unique vectors + counts\n",
    "- Compute all statistics using same functions as 12.2d\n",
    "- Save results to CSV: **one row** with all metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "`../data/analysis/qwen_comprehensive.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime:** <1 second (single trial)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Having Qwen's stats in the EXACT same format as the synthetic trials lets us do direct comparisons in 12.3e:\n",
    "- Qwen value vs synthetic (mean ± std)\n",
    "- How many σ away is Qwen from the synthetic distribution?\n",
    "- Which metrics match perfectly (topology) vs which have variance (population)?"
