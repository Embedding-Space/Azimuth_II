    "# 12.3e: Comprehensive Comparison - Qwen vs Synthetic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Load the CSVs from 12.2d and 12.2e, compute aggregate statistics, and GO COMPLETELY HAM with visualizations and comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Do\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Load Both Datasets\n",
    "- Synthetic: 10,000 rows from `synthetic_comprehensive_n10000.csv`\n",
    "- Qwen: 1 row from `qwen_comprehensive.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Compute Aggregate Statistics for Synthetic\n",
    "For each of the 20+ metrics:\n",
    "- Mean, median, std\n",
    "- Min, max, range\n",
    "- 25th, 75th percentiles\n",
    "- Skewness, kurtosis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Comparison Tables\n",
    "**Table 1: Basic Counts**\n",

    "### 4. Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot 1: Distribution Histograms**\n",
    "- 6-panel grid showing distributions of key metrics\n",
    "- Qwen value marked as vertical line\n",
    "- Show where Qwen falls in synthetic distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot 2: Bulls-Eye Confidence Plot (Updated)**\n",
    "- All 20+ metrics in horizontal bars\n",
    "- Mean ± 1σ/2σ bands\n",
    "- Qwen marker\n",
    "- Topology metrics show σ=0.000 (the smoking gun!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot 3: Population Distribution Comparison**\n",
    "- Ranked black hole populations\n",
    "- Qwen's actual distribution vs synthetic percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot 4: Topology Network Diagram**\n",
    "- Visual representation of Qwen's complete graph\n",
    "- All 13 nodes, all edges (78 connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Statistical Tests\n",
    "- For each metric: compute z-score (how many σ is Qwen from synthetic mean?)\n",
    "- Identify which metrics match within 1σ, 2σ, >2σ\n",
    "- Highlight topology invariants (σ = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Final Summary\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "- ✓ Topology: PERFECT match (components=1, density=1.000, zero variance)\n",
    "- ✓ Population: Close match (within 1-2σ on most metrics)\n",
    "- ✓ Spatial extent: Matches expected range\n",
    "- → **Conclusion:** Gaussian initialization at σ=1.5×10⁻⁹ reproduces Qwen's structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparison tables (printed + saved to markdown)\n",
    "- 4+ publication-quality figures saved to `../data/results/`\n",
    "- Summary statistics saved to `../data/analysis/comparison_summary.csv`\n",
