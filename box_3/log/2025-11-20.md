Talking with Alph about the epochs we can identify in the 1.22c plot of mean radius against time, using the Flannel 1 data set.

- The Inhale (t=0–6): Slight contraction, mysterious, unexplained
- The Sneeze (t=6–100): Explosive outward expansion
- Deceleration (t=100–300): Rapid slowing, expansion nearly stops
- Re-expansion (t=300–400): Linear second growth phase before the end
- Fimbulwinter (t=400+): Quantization freeze, tokens locked forever

Need to collect mucho data and see if these are real or just quirks of one random seed.

Experiment Flannel 3: It's Flannel 1 but ten times. Alph wisely trimmed down thre recorder to capture only the tokens we're interested in. Only 5 GB of data out of what could have been 12.

Next comes analysis.

Flannel 3 was flawed in a way we didn't bother to fully run down. Data that should have been identical (same random seeds) was not, so something else was different.

Now we're working on Flannel 4, which is ambitious. It will be built from the ground up to be based on a flexible experiment rig that we can hopefully reuse for a while as we study the dynamics of untrained tokens before t=1e3.

Found the flaw in Flannel 3, and it wasn't in Flannel 3 in at all. It was actually in the analysis. In the original analysis we were measuring mean radius relative to the origin. Then we measured mean radius relative to the centroid. Totally different curves. The inhale-sneeze phenomenon is real, and consistent across random seeds. Flannel 4 and its analysis (1.23a) demonstrates this.
