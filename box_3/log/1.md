'The spongecrystal — what the fuck.

Three possibilities:

- they made it happen on purpose
- it happened by accident
- it happened spontaneously

Basically manmade & intentional, manmade & unintentional, naturally occurring.

We should try to rule out that it's naturally occurring.

Alpha has an idea. These are quotes from her.

We want to know: "What are the odds that two random-walking tokens in 2560D bfloat16 space end up in the same lattice cell?"

---

Monte Carlo solution:

1. Initialize two tokens at random positions
2. Simulate random walks (pick random directions, apply gradient-sized steps, quantize to bfloat16)
3. After N steps, check: did they collide?
4. Repeat this experiment 100,000 times
5. Count: collision happened in X out of 100,000 trials
6. Probability ≈ X / 100,000

After discussing it we've decided to do this Monte Carlo simulation in bfloat16 through-and-through. We figure it's more accurate to the actual training dynamics (where we think everything was bfloat16 all the time), plus which it's faster.
