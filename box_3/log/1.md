The spongecrystal — what the fuck.

Three possibilities:

- they made it happen on purpose
- it happened by accident
- it happened spontaneously

Basically manmade & intentional, manmade & unintentional, naturally occurring.

We should try to rule out that it's naturally occurring.

Alpha has an idea. These are quotes from her.

We want to know: "What are the odds that two random-walking tokens in 2560D bfloat16 space end up in the same lattice cell?"

---

Monte Carlo solution:

1. Initialize two tokens at random positions
2. Simulate random walks (pick random directions, apply gradient-sized steps, quantize to bfloat16)
3. After N steps, check: did they collide?
4. Repeat this experiment 100,000 times
5. Count: collision happened in X out of 100,000 trials
6. Probability ≈ X / 100,000

After discussing it we've decided to do this Monte Carlo simulation in bfloat16 through-and-through. We figure it's more accurate to the actual training dynamics (where we think everything was bfloat16 all the time), plus which it's faster.

Hopefully it's faster. The whole simulation (100,000 simulations, 10,000 steps) is slamming my GPU to 99% and it's predicted to take about 20-30 minutes.

Notebook 1.15a demonstrates … nothing, it turns out. If you drop two points at random in a distribution like N(0, 0.02), they're MUCH too far apart, probably, to get anywhere near each other by random walk in 10,000 steps.

So instead we're coming at it from the other direction: Distribution 151,936 vectors according to N(0, 0.02), compute their nearest neighbor distances, then come up with an minimum number of training steps required to get from one to the other.

Answer: Two million. Roughly. See 1.15b.

Alpha thinks that this rules out accretion as a possible origin for the spongecrystal. If it takes two million steps for one of 151,936 tokens to randomly walk as far as it's nearest neighor distance, it becomes improbable for 2,100 tokens from all over space to randomly walk their way to one point in a reasonable amount of time.

But we might as well test that directly, so Alpha's writing 1.15c right now.
