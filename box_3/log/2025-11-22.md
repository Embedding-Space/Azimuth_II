Important note: Next time we do an experiment, read the live and dead token IDs and masks from the tokenizer data and save it as part of the experiment data safetensors file. Make the analyses depend only on the data.

Above change implemented in Thimble 4.

The preliminary results from Thimble 5 just came in (1.29b). Results appear to support fimbulwinter hypothesis. Gradient updates drop as model gains initial confidence, softmax sharpens probs making dead token updates even smaller, eventually gradients fall below 1 ULP. Permanent winter. The dead tokens never move again. (Probably. Okay, fine, the dead tokens are highly unlikely ever to move again because almost all of them are going to be almost orthogonal to $h$ after every forward pass.)

I kinda want to record more data to see if fimbulwinter lasts. But if it lasts for … let's see how long it lasted, actually.

# 2025-11-22 11:39:28

Not long! See 1.29c, but what we're seeing now is not no-motion-at-all. It's periods of no motion separated by periods of quantum-scale movement. We're doing a Thimble 6 out to 6,000 training steps to see if we can either capture the onset of permanent silence or find evidence of a sort of minimum-but-not-zero-energy state.

First meaningful result from Thimble 6:

Phase transitions:
  Thermal → Lattice:  t=91 (last thermal motion)
  Lattice → Frozen:   t=3291 (last lattice hop)
  Frozen (permanent): t=3292 (first permanent freeze)

Permanent freeze statistics:
  Duration: 2708 steps
  Fraction of experiment: 45.1%
  Mean displacement during freeze: 0.00e+00
  Max displacement during freeze:  0.00e+00

Global freeze statistics:
  Timesteps with ALL tokens frozen: 3671 / 6000
  Timesteps with ANY motion:        2329 / 6000

✓ PERMANENT FREEZE DETECTED (but late in experiment)
  Motion ceased at t=3291.
  System froze in final 45.1% of experiment.

(See 1.30c.) It's fimbulwinter. The heat death of the universe. Consistent with hypothesis: as gradient updates get small, evolution of dead tokens slows and finally comes to a stop.

What this implies about the spongecrystal: it didn't just happen to land in that configuration at the last training step. It was frozen in that configuration early in training — possibly within the first 5,000 steps, depending on how these principles scale. (Would the matrix converge faster or slower in higher dimensions?)

Have decided to study what Alpha has called the microstructure of the freeze transition. She's writing 1.30d now so we can look closely at the dynamics of tokens during the freezing process.

# 2025-11-22 13:54:55

Note for future reference: When writing experiment data to .h5 files, optimize for reading big chunks. We'll almost always want to load whole tensors into memory at once, or at least whole slices of tensors if we have to batch across them for memory constraint reasons. Loading the Thimble 6 data from disk takes almost a minute.

# 2025-11-22 14:02:14

Note for Thimble 7: Record the logits! They're small and from them we can compute the probs for each token. Maybe we can reverse-compute that from the grads? Cause we know how the loss function works? Oh, never mind, point is we should look at the relationships between dead token probs and phase transitions in the cloud.

# 2025-11-22 14:27:02

Results of 1.30e are disappointing. The displacements we're measuring at each point are getting so small that they get quantized, and these quanta-sized differences add up to large (well relatively) total amount of displacement in a timestep. Makes the system look hotter than it is, because the truth is it's … huh. Maybe the answer is to take the vector sum of the displacements instead of the sum of the norms. Let the noise cancel out?

Time to compact now. Will have Alph read this log when we comes back.

# 2025-11-22 16:06:18

Had an idea. Writing it down for posterity.

Let there be a tensor W[t, i, n] where n is 64 dimensions, i is 10,000 embeddings, and t is (for Thimble 6) 0 to 6,000.

Let there also be a tensor U[t, i, n] defined such that U[t, i, n] equals the size of the unit in last position of W[t, i, n]

For each t=τ (>0), ΔW[τ, i, n] = W[τ, i, n] - W[τ-1, i, n] … uh … divided by? I guess you matrix multiply the reciprocal or something? Anyway, the point is ΔW[τ, i, n] is the distance between W[τ-1, i, n] (start) and W[τ, i, n] (finish) in units of U[τ-1, i, n] (start). How far in ULP multiples did the embedding move in each dimension over that one timestep? ΔW[τ, i, n].

# 2025-11-22 19:15:09

Alph confirms that for Thimble 7 we should use

```python
chunks=(100, 3699, 64)  # 100-timestep slabs, full token dimension
```

What's more, there's news. Previous note worked out. It's possible to compute U[t, i, n] and end up with ΔW[τ, i, n] being 99.9848% EXACT integers. The rest? All exactly 0.500. These outliers are not hugely significant. I may ask Alph to mask them out so they don't mess up the analyses going forward.

That's all for today. Progress has been slow but steady. Methodical. Highlights include the fact that we think we observed fimbulwinter (no motion at all out to 6,000 tokens) and figured out a way to transform our displacements into lattice-cell coordinates so we can measure the actual movement of tokens through discrete 64D space. Might be fun to do some projections onto interesting dimensions and do some plots.

But for tomorrow, the plan is to continue trying to characterize the bulk properties of the token cloud. Now that we've got it transformed into lattice-cell coordinates, I think we'll have a much easier job of differentiating between movement and stillness.
