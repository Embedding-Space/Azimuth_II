Important note: Next time we do an experiment, read the live and dead token IDs and masks from the tokenizer data and save it as part of the experiment data safetensors file. Make the analyses depend only on the data.

Above change implemented in Thimble 4.

The preliminary results from Thimble 5 just came in (1.29b). Results appear to support fimbulwinter hypothesis. Gradient updates drop as model gains initial confidence, softmax sharpens probs making dead token updates even smaller, eventually gradients fall below 1 ULP. Permanent winter. The dead tokens never move again. (Probably. Okay, fine, the dead tokens are highly unlikely ever to move again because almost all of them are going to be almost orthogonal to $h$ after every forward pass.)
