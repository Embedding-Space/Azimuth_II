Question: How could the Qwen 3 4B spongecrystal have formed, and given that it did form, how did it last to the end of training? Support for the fimbulwinter hypothesis suggests that if it lasted through the first few thousand training steps, it might have lasted as a permanent frozen fixture. But looking into the fimbulwinter hypothesis has raised the possibility of a token supernova — a hundred or a thousand steps with really high displacements, well above the ULP threshold, where everything in our model moves a lot. Could this token supernova have torn the spongecrystal apart? Or is it really not at all like a supernova and that's a terrible metaphor?

I want to understand the supernova better. Can we put bounds on it? Does it start exactly at t=1 or does it ramp up? When does it end? And then once we've identified it, I wanna look inside it and see what's going on.

Maybe we need to go back to our lattice coordinates and look for the time when the … uh … mean displacement … drops below … 32,768 cells? Maybe that's a way to start looking for boundaries to the supernova. If it even is a supernova.
