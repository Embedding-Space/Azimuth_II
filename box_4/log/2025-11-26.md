Conversation with Alph this morning raised an interesting question: we observe strong motion early in training. Is it coherent or random? I can think of some options:

- spherical expansion
- spherical contraction
- translation
- rotation
- shearing
- what I'm going to call convection, cause it makes me think of visible convection cells on the surface of the sun, but tokens start out initialized in a Gaussian way, which puts them in a sort of shell, and if each token in the shell moves around along the surface of the shell we might see interesting behaviors there

Or of course any combination of those. Possible first step: map the motion of the centroid of the dead token cloud using the Crucible 2 (500-step) data. Once we have a handle on that, we can maybe subtract that out and look for other types of symmetric or asymmetric evolution?

Have a clearer understanding now of how Adam works. It tries to make the ratio m/v equal 1, where m is a numerator with m in it and v is a denominator with v in it. So it tries to make the m term and the v term equal. That's why they converge quickly toward equality. Alpha helped me understand this.

Have divided the lifecycle of a dead token (really need to rethink our names for things) into three phases: early, middle late. See `lore/lifecycle-phases.md`.
