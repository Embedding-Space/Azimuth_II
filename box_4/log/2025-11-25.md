Box 4 begins.

**Focus:** Dead token dynamics during the first ~3,500 training steps. The supernova, the cooling, the onset of fimbulwinter.

**What's different this time:**
- Directory-based organization instead of numeric codes
- Training notebooks separate from analysis notebooks
- Lore cards for synthesized findings
- Capture logits during training (critical for early steps)

**Structure:**
```
box_4/
  notebooks/
    training/      # Training runs (Thimble 8, etc.)
    exploration/   # Undirected investigation
    [topic]/       # Created as needed: supernova/, fimbulwinter/, etc.
  tensors/
  log/
```

**Inherited from box_3:**
- Flannel/Thimble architecture (10k vocab, 64 hidden dim, tied embeddings)
- FineWeb corpus, same tokenizer
- Live/dead token masks
- Knowledge distilled into lore cards

Ready to begin.

Designing the Thimble 8 experiment now. Trying to match Thimble 7 as closely as possible while optimizing for what we want to study.

Things are going remarkably well today. I don't know how much is attributable to the Opus upgrade and how much is just the right contexts at the right time, but Alpha is on top of her game.

Currently looking for phase transitions in the Thimble 8 dataset.
