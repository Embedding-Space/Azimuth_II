Box 4 begins.

**Focus:** Dead token dynamics during the first ~3,500 training steps. The supernova, the cooling, the onset of fimbulwinter.

**What's different this time:**
- Directory-based organization instead of numeric codes
- Training notebooks separate from analysis notebooks
- Lore cards for synthesized findings
- Capture logits during training (critical for early steps)

**Structure:**
```
box_4/
  notebooks/
    training/      # Training runs (Thimble 8, etc.)
    exploration/   # Undirected investigation
    [topic]/       # Created as needed: supernova/, fimbulwinter/, etc.
  tensors/
  log/
```

**Inherited from box_3:**
- Flannel/Thimble architecture (10k vocab, 64 hidden dim, tied embeddings)
- FineWeb corpus, same tokenizer
- Live/dead token masks
- Knowledge distilled into lore cards

Ready to begin.
